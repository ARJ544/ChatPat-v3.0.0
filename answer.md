Based on the provided context, there is no direct explanation of the difference between speed and velocity in a tabular format. The context discusses acceleration, changes in velocity, and calculations of speed and average speed in a falling object scenario.

However, I can provide the difference between speed and velocity based on general physics principles.

| Feature        | Speed                                   | Velocity                                           |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition** | The rate at which an object covers distance. | The rate at which an object changes its position.  |
| **Nature**     | Scalar quantity                         | Vector quantity                                    |
| **Information**| Only magnitude                          | Magnitude and direction                            |
| **Change**     | Changes if the object speeds up, slows down, or changes direction. | Changes if the object's speed or direction (or both) changes. |
| **Example**    | A car travels at 60 km/h.               | A car travels at 60 km/h **north**.                |
