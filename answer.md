Force is defined as the cause of motion. It is what changes the speed or direction of an object.

The context provides a few formulas related to force:

*   **F = m × a** (where 'm' is mass and 'a' is acceleration)
*   **F = m × g** (where 'm' is mass and 'g' is acceleration due to gravity)
*   **W = m × g** (where 'W' is weight, 'm' is mass, and 'g' is acceleration due to gravity. The weight of an object is the force with which it is attracted towards the earth.)
*   **F = G × (M × m) / d²** (where 'F' is the force between two objects, 'G' is a constant of proportionality, 'M' and 'm' are the masses of the two objects, and 'd' is the distance between them.)
