Force is described as the cause of motion. It is needed to change the speed or the direction of an object's motion. The weight of an object is the force with which it is attracted towards the earth.

The formula for force is given by:
F = m × a

When considering the force due to gravity, the formula becomes:
F = m × g

And for the weight of an object:
W = m × g
